Automate the publishing of multiple posts and pages at the same time.

== Description ==

Synchronized Post Publisher (SPP) for WordPress, allows you to group pages and posts (of any type) together and publish them all simutaneously.

Let's say you're about to release a new product, or an update to an existing one. This product may needs product page, a release post and maybe even some documentation.

SPP enables you to create all of the above in advance and publish them all at the same time with minimal effort.

Sure, there are other ways to achieve this. For example, you could visit each post individually and publish it, or you could visit the edit post page for each post type and publish via Quick Edit, but it's just not as quick and seamless as the Synchronized Post Publisher for WordPress.
